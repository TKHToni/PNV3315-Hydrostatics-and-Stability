# PNV3315-Hydrostatics-and-Stability
University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) PNV3315 course assignment that takes as input the table of offsets of a ship in .xlsxl format and outputs some of the Hydrostatics proprerties as a function of the the ship's draft. The source of the table of offsets is from a software called DELFTship and represents a tug boat. Note that this code was developed specifically to take this table of offsets as input and may need some adaptations if you input a different table.
